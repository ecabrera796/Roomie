## Project Base Requirements

### Language and Framework

For our project, we decided to utilize basic HTML and CSS to design the web app, but we will make use of MongoDB, React.js, as well as Node.JS for handling the vast majority of the back-end and front-end actions.

### Operating System platform

We will utilize Ubuntu 18.04 as primary operating system, simply because it is the version of Linux we are all most comfortable with.

### Use of Data Store/Storage

MongoDB for data storage.


## Sprint 1 Break down.

Our Primary Focus for this sprint was establishing order and guidelines to ensure work in the future sprints can be done easier. In this sprint, there aren't many deliverables, however on our GitHub you can find the project guidelines as well as the template documents for building out our system.

## Sprint 2 Goals

With Sprint 2, we are focusing on getting tangible deliverables completed. We will focus primarily on designing the UI, but also perfecting the base data.

With Sprint 2 we are focused on creating a Minimal Viable Product, working to make as many mistakes as possible so that we can fine-tune it and begin testing it with actual data.
