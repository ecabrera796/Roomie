## Sprint 3 Goals

Our goal for Sprint 3 was to finalize all that we need to start making our artboard designs come to life. We wanted to ensure we implement security now so we could have it ready for when we start creating our web pages. We also wanted to have our database schema drawn out so we could start building the database and populate it as we are building the web pages.

- Configure Node environment with [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
  - pm2 is an advanced process manger for Node.js with a built in load balance. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and facilitate common DevOps tasks.
