## Sprint 5 Goals

The goals for sprint 5 were as follows:

- Connect all react components to their proper buttons and functions
- Connect forms to post to the api and create a user
- Create React component for the listings that a user can see
- Create React component for the Leasing Agents if they are selling a property
- Experiment with saving images onto mongodb

For the this sprint, the goals that we have placed for ourselves is to connect the api calls to the React components. This will help us make the application interact with the mongodb database. We will also need to test the database for injections and ensure that the api call are secure.

## Completed goals

- Create user
- Log in as a new user
- Develop the template for the admin page
- Develop the template for the listing view
- Rewrite way that react component are called using react browser router
- Design API for admin page

We were unable to finish the admin page this sprint. We attempted to utilize a service to help us create it, but were having issues with getting it to function properly. As such, we will have it as a goal for the next sprint.

## Sprint 6 To-Do

- Connect API to work for admin page
- Connect API to listing view
- Connect API to creating a new listing
- Create Template for listing view
- Insert Test data
- Complete Admin page.
- Redesign homepage and connect all pages to homepage.
- Install resource monitoring tool.
- Ensure all calls are routed properly to HTTPS

## Sprint 5 Rubric Info

1. The Primary language we are using is Javascript.
2. The operating system that we are using is Linux and Windows for development. We have some developers that are using Linux as their native development envirment and current we have implemented a npm linux start for the react application. The frameworks that we are using are Node js and React js. We are using node to build the application and routing while we are using react to build the components of the application
3. The database that we are using is Mongodb.
4. The Data encryption at rest os JWT.
5. We have disabled master/slave relationships in favor of replica sets. We are using a redis caching server. We are also using api that can manage the call to the database.
6. We are using React js to manage responsive design and we recently connect to material ui to manage buttons and any componenet elements.
7. We do have self signing cert with CertBot to generate a self signed certificate. We have change the permissions of the web server to change to https.
8. We have will have to manage the user authentification and currently we have implemented authenticated for the servers and the API calls will check the authentification of the calls.
9. Our development enviroments are done by running the npm start dev from the server. The server is located in the app folder. Once this is running we are allowed to see the react application.
10. All our designs can be seen in the design files along with the video of the application.
11. Currently our flowcharts of the application are in the reports and in the images folder. These contain the current database relationships.

12. Our trello is currently accurate with the completed tasks.
13. Currently we have not implemented our 15 test data since we need to first completely connect the api calls to the react components.
