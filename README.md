Private team repo for ITMT 430

## Github Guidelines

For GitHub, we should all fork the team repository and set the primary repo as a remote repository. Any changes we make to our code should be pushed locally and then changes should be merged with a majority consent on GitHub. This should cut down on the amount of merge conflicts and allow us to all work faster without much worry of destroying the project accidentally, or accidentally uploading unnecessary files.

### Introductions

#### Antoine Foggs

Hey, everyone! We all more or less know each other, but I still believe we should do an introduction. I'm used to working with git, and I have some experience working with vagrant already, as well as some cloud services. In regards to programming, I am capable but it isn't my strong suit. I am great at managing projects and understanding how to integrate different technologies together. I also don't mind trouble shooting and learning whatever is needed to be helpful.

Feel free to visit my [Github](http://www.github.com/Afoggs) to see some of the work I've done.
