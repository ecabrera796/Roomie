### Team Member Introductions

#### Antoine Foggs

Hey, everyone! We all more or less know each other, but I still believe we should do an introduction. I'm used to working with git, and I have some experience working with vagrant already, as well as some cloud services. In regards to programming, I am capable but it isn't my strong suit. I am great at managing projects and understanding how to integrate different technologies together. I also don't mind trouble shooting and learning whatever is needed to be helpful.

Feel free to visit my [Github](http://www.github.com/Afoggs) to see some of the work I've done.
